# Project Abstract
This project is build for semester project for CS-668

In project we aim to analyze a system, a system can be group of different components including like Personnel Computer, LAN , routers etc.
We analyze these assets according to there CPE names and fetch the corresponding CVEs from the NIST database with there public API
For example CPE names for each asset is 
`cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:powerpoint:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`

Each component of the whole system can have multiple CVEs and based on that CVEs we find the threats for those components and then we try to find the corresponding mitigations and list them out in the most effective manner which can reduce the overall system risk score.


# Project Structure
This project contains 3 parts
1. Frontend 
2. Backend
3. Assesment model and datasets

## Frontend
Frontend is build using reactJs technology which consumes the APIs from backend. Based on the data from the APIs we update the details on the UI

## Backend
Backend part is build using NodeJs and database we have used is MongoDB, which is hosted on remote server on linux machine.

## Assesment model and datasets
Datasets contains the list of CVEs and there corresponding vulnerabilites and the map for probability of the vulnerabilities, which are used to fetch the threats corresponding to there CVEs.

# Getting Started with Frontend for Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
