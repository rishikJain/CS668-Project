# Project Abstract
This project served as the semester project for CS668

In this project, we aim to analyze a system of different components like PCs, routers, switches, servers, databases etc. to come up with a system risk score and a possible list of controls. We then simulate applying these controls on assets to come up with a reduced risk score.

We analyze the assets according to there CPE names and fetch the corresponding CVEs from the NIST database using public APIs
Each asset can have multiple CVEs and based on that CVEs, we find the threats for those assets, the corresponding mitigations and list them in the most effective manner which can reduce the overall system risk score.


# Project Structure
This project contains 3 parts
1. Frontend 
2. Backend
3. Assesment model and datasets

## Frontend
Frontend is build using reactJs technology which consumes the APIs from backend. Based on the data from the APIs we update the details on the UI.

To run the application in local host .We need to follow the following steps to run the application

1) git clone <repo>

2) cd frontend

3) npm i or npm install

4) npm start

After final step (step 4) .you will see the running application in browser.

## Backend
Backend part is build using NodeJs and database we have used is MongoDB, which is hosted on remote server on linux machine.

## Assesment model and datasets
Datasets contains the mappings for CVE and MITRE ATT&CK (tactics and techniques), threats and probabilities, threats and mitigations.
For formulae related to risk calculation, please refer to `Risk Assessment Model.pdf`

<!-- # Getting Started with Frontend for Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
